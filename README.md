## about the project
this is a university project about directed weighted graph and a game.  
In the game there is a random graph and on the edges of the graph there is "pokemons",  
 if your agent to through the pokemon you get points.
There are to factors that compute the score, the first is how many points collected during the run, 
 the second is how many times you update the server to move your agent.

We chose to build the graph from hashmap because almost all the objects
 have a key field.
We chose dijkstras algorithm because it's fast.
